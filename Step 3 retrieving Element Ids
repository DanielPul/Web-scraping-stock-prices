Step 3: Retrieving Element Ids
We identify the element by looking at the rendered web page,
but it's impossible for a script to determine that. To find the target element,
get its element ID and enter it into the script. Getting the ID of an item is pretty easy.
Let's say you want the item id for the stock name.
All we have to do is go to the URL and see the text in the console. Get the text next to the class

Let's iterate through the list of stocks we need and use soup.find() to find the tag with the specified id and print the company, current stock price, change in percentage of stocks and volume of stocks.

company = soup.find('h1', {'class': 'usph14Head displaySmall'}).text

price = soup.find('span', {'class': 'uht141Pri contentPrimary displayBase'}).text

change = soup.find('div', {'class': 'uht141Day bodyBaseHeavy contentNegative'}).text

volume=soup.find('table', {'class': 'tb10Table col l5'}).find_all('td')[1].text

As we can see the price and change has the same Class Id. So let's fund all the span tags and use the find_all('span')[tag number] and extract the text.

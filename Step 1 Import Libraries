Step 1: Import Libraries
We import the modules for Pandas, Requests and Beautiful soup. Add a user agent and a header declaration.
This makes sure that the target website for web scraping won't automatically classify 
the traffic as spam and end up being blacklisted. Many user agents are available at https://developers.whatismybrowser.com/

import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import pandas as pd
import time

headers = {'user-agent':'Mozilla/5.0 \
            (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) \
            AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) \
            Chrome/84.0.4147.105 Safari/537.36'}
